-1,i respect you boss when is phase papi sar i like you hits the nail on its head we need to reimagine singapore if you want to learn about the sorry state of our media today read about how the newspapers and printing presses act was enacted although i might have accidentally say these remarks in the past i will be a good ally from now and do not encourage racism against minority i totally feel seen this is hard to read a sikh boy shares with us about his experiences with racism in school in these submissions we hear from people of different races and faiths who share their experiences with discrimination in school crying face reminiscent of the racial insults i had endured in primary school too speaking of holidays i was the camp duty officer for both chinese new year holidays as a newly commissioned singapore armed forces officer probably against protocol but i was green and clueless and the only junior officer in the whole camp so it is obligatory right s still on ns as a reservist they conducted a reservist training briefing callup on hari raya eve this time i flipped and asked why this day of all days for a briefing would they have called us up on chinese new year eve i asked no response to that but they eventually relented and changed the date time to stand up and speak up we need to be able to acknowledge such issues in singapore and address them we are not trying to assign blame open conversations are always helpful in understanding one another better and strengthening our relationships read about unlearning racism colorism in the muslim community link in biography days left till body positivity session dm us to sign up for venue details a few days ago the un voted on a resolution combating glorification of nazism neo nazism and other practices that contribute to fueling contemporary forms of racism singapore rightfully voted for the motion in this regard we stand with and applaud the singapore government we must spare no expense in the fight against nazis and agents who discriminate based on race can be reported to the council for estate agencies check out our ig highlights on rental racism for more information as muslims it is our spiritual duty to be steadfast to the principles of social justice and deep compassion in islam it is not enough to be passive and fall onto the ease of toxic positivity we must be active in doing the personal and communal work of eradicating violent systems in our lives allah has created diversity in humankind by design so that we may appreciate each other s differences and respect them understanding that it does not change the essential fact that we are all god s beautiful creations also considering how most of the sap schools are top schools too in their own merit and are known to produce many of future leaders the fact that they remain almost chinese do mean that in a sense chinese representation is guaranteed at the highest level of leadership within the government but then again a vast majority of selected scholars are chinese anyway taiwan use of the video is in the last slide we hope singapore comes clean on why they claimed to be not able to find models from the minority races when instead they chose not to hire them to be clear this is not a situation where they simply decided not to hire diverse models rather they chose not to hire and then pretended that they could not find any we understand that this thing where fashion shops only feature chinese models of a particular body build is not limited to just this shop we believe that it is indeed important for fashion shops in singapore to cater for and feature a diverse range of models yes this was a big surprise to me moving to singapore it is absolutely awful rampant brother singapore does not have much freedom literally officers can enter your house without a warrant there is nothing that you can do to stop the incumbent government its like telling the china political party to not do something it does not work your experience may give the impression to that all sap schools teach maths in chinese other than chinese language and literature or some humanities subjects like music and antigent rapid test additionally regarding school being independent as far as i know of funding is from the catholic church or donation as for your experience it is from a time before most of the followers on this page are even born and mine is a different phase in the recent past there are teachers who choose to teach in english and there are those who go on explaining the problem sum in chinese that is exactly what happened as recent as years regarding music and antigent rapid test the sec depending on the teacher yes they just give up and speak chinese now you are making untruthful statements about the impression i make no mention of that and simply stated the facts of what happen years ago ask any students then the math classes for most of the good math teachers were in chinese that is exactly what happen i understand chinese accents better

point it is only right that we appreciate the new effort to reach out to more segments of the muslim community while the previous mufti focused his efforts on the malay community with most of his lectures being in malay the new mufti has however chosen to produce more english content i was even pleasantly surprised that salamsg television that he launched features the indian imams including bengali they even produced tamil bengali subtitles for the end of Ramadan khutbah so this definitely seems to be a promising start at least they are making the effort to reach out to us and i definitely appreciate their efforts for that i sincerely hope that relations and communications between the communities strengthen further in future it does not have to be based upon the number of

submit to the un convention for elimination of all forms of racial discrimination committee elimination racial discrimination arcs is doing a survey gather more meaningful data on the themes of freedom of expression housing employment and education which will be included in the report this survey is aims to center the voices and experiences of minority racial groups in singapore if you are a person from a minority racial group who is living has previously lived in singapore please take the survey we need to collect responses in weeks we would also appreciate it if you could share the survey with family friends acquaintances who are also an ethnic minority in singapore the shadow report will also be shared publicly once we have finished it survey link the arcs is a coalition of individuals that have come together for the purpose of putting together this shadow report the team is led by brown people the individual identities of the team members cannot be divulged due to safety reasons you can reach out to the team at should you have any questions and or feedback racism stemed from an existence of race doing a self promotion of their creed is superior to everyone else in order to continue existing as a race a fundamental pros cons to the racist issue a catch racial harmony is a different fish highlighting a friendly existence in the same space for a common good this required a fairness togetherness as one singapore with her decades of efforts promotions have instilled a belief that singapore as a nation is so the recent mixed marriage uproar is of a very different dimension no longer racial harmony of our founding it pulled to the forefront the mixed race part of the community that are in the very minority presently it is a very choice thing with new consequences faced by each union their offsprings if singapore is to jump into this promotion singapore will need to do an sudden disruption on a national scale to accommodate future consequences of this new culture as a small nation singapore will be hard put to dish out this to other nations we cannot be a sanctuary for too many foreign mixed marriages it is not a workable image attraction we cannot be left holding the babies our present core society will likely be destroyed from within the growing up pressure issues eventual loyalty issues needs to be considered singapore first prime minister did mentioned about the catholic network other networks considering singapore security i think this new dimensional mixed race issue needs serious think in relating to both internal external forces we cannot be a mecca for the many foreign mixed people out there singapore if going up this road embracing this new dimension needs to put in super efforts to make everything work no nation including the us uk has ever made this work singapore may need to become something else alien to what we know of singapore today
1,major spoilers ahead but trust us there is no huge loss if you have not watched this movie on a personal note we have not seen the movie since the first time we did in and we could not sit through the whole movie again to create this post yes it is that bad leader of the opposition links to further reading are in our biography it so amazing and you guys do not think so sometime looking at them which make your day when you had a busy day having a cup of hot coffee relax your mind while you enjoy watching them countries like japan india and others in south america are already mass distributing one of the antiparastic drug protocols to their people it is cost effective and works we could be doing the same our measures lack the early treatment component and needs a reboot i am still waiting for our mps and ministers to take a pay cut because half the time they have not been working much since covid and the other half of the time they are bumbling about trying to deal with their ignorance lack of specialised knowledge banality and lack of common sense if malaysia can implement salary cuts for their ministers and mps who do more than ours do as their country is not the size of a postage stamp we can certainly do the same too preaching words of hope and resilience to us ordinary citizens while they still draw the minimum a month or in the case of display photo for instance millions a month hits very different esp to those who are struggling desperately to earn even a month while jobless and unable to get a job for more than a year the words of a man with a cushy job and never had to go around begging for thousands of jobs ring very different from the words of another who is starving to death and battling depression in this climate this is the closest the government will come to admitting they screwed up airport workers from a zone which received arrivals from countries went to have their meals at terminal basement and we suspect from there it transmitted to members of public that visited the place transport minister ong ye kung said honestly during situations like these we rather be proven wrong ng yat chung should resign this former general ran both singapore cotainer shipping company and media publisher to the ground and if his behaviour at the press conference earlier is anything to go by things will not improve with him at the helm shareholders must demand accountability from him and the rest of the board in any other place he would have been sacked by now end of story we seriously do not understand why this is so hard to grasp for some it is a shame that this even has to be spelt out let us combat racism together another high school alumna speaks up also this may be an opportune time to remind everyone that just because ms x was not racist or was nice towards you it does not mean that she could not have been racist or unreasonable towards others while i am ethnically chinese and did not face specifically racist treatment from her i stand with my fellow minority friends many of whom have faced such horrible experiences i am writing in because i firmly believe that one teacher cannot act so outrageously for decades without being held accountable if there is a sound mechanism within the high school system that regulates this it cannot be that the high school staff are completely unaware of her acts as evidences by the numerous comments over thus far with students and from across a decade sharing similar experiences and many pointing out that they know who the teacher is right from the description as such it simply cannot be that the school has been unaware of it all these years dear killshot whoever you are we want you to know that you are not alone you will never be alone friend the community here will always have your back we will continue to relentlessly advocate and fight for all minorities to have a better and more just future we are clearly on the right track we have made people like him so uncomfortable that is the power of truth the truth may be uncomfortable but ignoring it does not change anything i will personally never understand why people get so worked up or defensive when stories about racism are shared we will not let the naysayers and the doubters derail our efforts not even for a second racists do not take a break so why should we this is the very real effect of gaslighting and downplaying the experiences of minorities but we must not let it get to us the movement will prevail as history has always shown we receive some hate messages everyday that is fine but do not go after those who entrust us with their stories and confide in us for you to go after victims of racism that is a minorities cannot ever speak up without getting gaslighted or having doubt thrown at their stories you want to know why so many stories sound similar it is because so many minorities share similar lived experiences for the record every word every emotion every experience in the series is real it may be hard for you to believe because of your privilege but it is real let me make this clear we will not stand for any gaslighting or you are free to attack us but do not go after the authenticity of the experiences we share when you do not even have a shred of evidence if you want to bet real money put your money where your mouth is we will donate all the monies to mutual aid p s if you want to know what are views on racism go check out his comment history wink or smirk you know when people tell me that they are surprised by the racist outbursts or ask questions like wah teacher leh how can like that i will tell them to go talk to any working class minority and i can guarantee you they will share similar lived experiences in the past few days we have received many messages from all of you who have shared about your experiences with racism we appreciate your trust and confidentiality in us and we will always strive to listen and advocate for all of you recent events have shown me that one thing is clear we will no longer remain silent or be resigned to fate we will no longer accept that this is the way things are if you are racist you will be held accountable we will call it out we will demand accountability and we will fight for a more just and equitable society for all of us racial harmony is not a one day school celebration but an ongoing struggle we at will always be on the side of the struggle i hope next time when minorities speak up we take them seriously we should not accuse them of stirring religious tensions or sedition we should also think about what kind of signals are sent when we say things like we are not ready for an indian prime minister or if you naughty person of indian descent will come catch you such rhetoric is hurtful to minorities and it also serves to normalise racism we all want to work together against racism sometimes this work involves serious reflection and difficult conversations but it must be done repost from we also hope that going forward when minorities speak up about racism and chinese privilege we hear them out take their concerns seriously and have difficulty but necessary conversations about race instead of accusing them of sedition or stirring racial tensions thank you we must all work together to end racism at its roots it exists and it is a problem gaslighting makes it difficult to snuff out it pays to be cautious and aware pensive face sorry that you had to go through that wish there was a national anti discrimination rule carried out by ministry of manpower on this rejecting competent workers just because they choose to practice their religious beliefs does not match with singapore s multi racial and religious harmony identity that the country s often being promoted as even national sports teams must wear uniforms but some countries allow their players to wear simple head covering and inner sleeves leggings inside the team s sports uniform this appears to show teachers discussing a complaint about their child being group with people of other races if this is true i really pity the teachers they are in a difficult situation it must be very difficult for teachers to help children recognise and unlearn racial biases when their parents are the source of the racism are you going back to malaysia my sister took it lightly and explained that the luggage was for me and she had come to drop it off he simple added go back lah go back to malaysia go back now we do not want you here his tone progressively got more aggressive towards the end i told my sister then enough is enough we should no longer stay silent we have as much right to be here as anyone else we need to speak up make it difficult for people to be comfortable with racism and stand up for ourselves i would not want for us to keep silent for this is not the singapore i would want my children to grow up in the experience left me so frustrated that i could not do anything more we waited till our ride hailing company came and left this is definitely not what i want to teach my child in the near future and i hope that we will be able to change our mindset as times goes by come on we are in the century and i am pretty sure everyone will have to go through proper education in singapore with all the news outlet reporting about racism cases with all the stories about racism being shared around i hope that we all will be able to change our mindset and also educate the people around us its and if you are still being racist to others here is a big fuck you you have no fucking idea how much it hurts to be discriminated against just because you have a different skin tone let us be more open minded and accepting towards others please a chinese lady who is in an relationship with an indian man faces racism from her own family most of us indian muslims can relate to this to some extent i believe this situation arises out of a lack of awareness and education these kinds of things should have been taught in all those social studies or cme lessons in primary schools concepts such as race and religion are still not so clear to some chinese my colleague asked me are you indian or muslim i replied both and he looked surprised face with rolling eyes now i would like to get into the details of this term indian that we singapore citizens use i would like to clarify that indian is not a language but a race and importantly hindu is not a language but a religion we do not speak indian or hindu that some do ask we speak tamil or hindi or many other languages did you know that there are more than languages or dialects spoken in india as mother tongues according to the latest analysis of a census released rukhshana maufiqah illustration by i have always noticed the way race and religion have seemed more separate for some and synonymous for others being malay and muslim to me in my experience has been a commonly understood norm in society where race and religion overlap however being indian and muslim is always perceived to be antonymous one is the opposite of the other instead of sharing the same space even till now i notice the ease of which other muslims who look the part can do things while someone like myself am restricted socially by odd looks or sometimes the inability of others to comprehend how an indian can be indian and muslim sarah farheenshah begum i was probably the most proud to be a south asian muslim woman when i am in the presence of my family and still am til today to be honest i never felt proud to be south asian when i was in school i always felt a little left out some teachers would purposely fake an indian accent even though i was not indian in front of the whole class when talking to me and classmates would talk about me while being in my presence thinking i did not understand a word they were saying being in such an environment made me feel embarrassed about my ethnicity fz sri lankan when will the blatant discrimination end looks like there is something happening to indian folks in singapore every week this is disrespectful to people of the hindu faith what is the point of mocking religious activities how intolerant has this country become my sister shared with me before about a tertiary education instituion mate making fun of an indian said anyone who wants chocolate milk can go to devi not the real name he laughed coz he thought it was a funny joke it is downright rude racist and totally unacceptable ah this one hits so close to home i did not alienate myself from my faith as a sikh but there were plenty of experiences i faced that honestly made me question why i even bothered people can be so demeaning and rude i will not ask people to respect my faith that is unfortunately too much to ask i just wish they would leave me alone this is a breakdown based on our own opinion and understanding of what has happened this is not meant to sow any religious racial discord or because enmity the first step in tackling racism is acknowledging the problem exists when minorities point out racism it is not with any intention to sow racial religious discord or enmity the intention is to raise awareness have open and respectful conversations about these issues and collectively overcome them speech balloon dear is it so hard to use the word racist i also want to add that people may push back that this is a grey area but it really is not it is just a way to justify racism preferences can be racist the security association of singapore calls out racism and ageism from a managing agent the managing agent has since issued an apology this christmas we wish for an end to casual racism especially in the form of jokes like these no they are not funny if you hear such jokes being made even if minorities laugh along internalised racism is a conversation for another day do not hesitate to call it out we agree but we need to see more concrete action including corrective action for example we could start with rental racism we have one of the most educated populations in the world and we are more than capable about having a civil discussion about race we need more honest and frank discussions we also must ensure that laws like sedition and maintenance of religious harmony act do not unintentionally deter much needed honest and open conversations about race relations in singapore pretending everything is fine and dandy is not the way forward we hope this changes and is not just lip service reposting because our previous post got removed with no reasons stated the next time you face a racist landlord or agent take a few moments to complain to council for estate agencies together we will fight racism in yesterday s forum about race and racism in singapore it was said that facing discrimination when looking for a job is a form of we have to disagree it is a form of blatant racism you should not downplay racism by saying it is a joke who is laughing sexual racism is an important topic that queer organisations need to address educate and stand against dating and sexual preferences do not arise in a vacuum we are influenced by our implicit biases racial stereotypes media portrayals of ethnic minorities and many more to say that it is simply a preference absolves individuals of any responsibility which is extremely common in the gay community gay folks should not only fight for equality in terms of lgbtqia rights but also fight against racism within their own community and elsewhere if not we will never achieve collective liberation i really hope the government reconsiders the need to hold open discussions as you have articulated in your post it just feels rather authoritarian that such decisions were made with people in certain positions without taking into account the views what divisive issue it does not make sense at all to me because if it was stated in the nation s pledge regardless of race language or religion why should there be a divisive issue about this tudung controversy if there is a problem the government should face it head on and learn to fix it instead of just putting it off as a divisive issue or making others uncomfortable those are just excuses that does not add up to any value prove to us that instead of just putting it off they will do something about it now its people its time to move forward from irrelevant issues like these and just learn to respect everyone is religions yes but the pressure has to come from ordinary citizens as you say if there is no pressure or discussion at parliament the government will not see the need to even think about it so ordinary citizens need to take steps to make this issue viral enough to get policymakers to debate on it i remember social studies preaching emphasis on meritocracy in essence that is supposed to mean that education is the great leveller by that logic is not the existence of sap schools be hypocritical i feel that such schools are one of many reasons why the best we can ever achieve is racial tolerance look at this tasteless video by the incumbent government candidate who lost in constituency held by opposition i do not think the racist attack is something that we can and should make light of we also should not be portraying vile racist attackers in such a fun and harmless light we need some clarity from the police as to when and why they ask people to file complaint before commencing investigations is this also the norm for cases involving domestic abuse or violence it is honestly quite sad and concerning why this victim of a racially charged assault was told to file a complaint we really need some answers i cried watching the other day and you are calling me a racist is this some kind of sick joke eudxria as far as apologies go and we have see many this is the worst and most appalling why do people love talking down to migrant workers do they think they are superior human beings or something thank you gangaa for calling this out and standing up for them nazi symbols must be banned sympathisers must be or counselled plain and simple there is no fucking room for debate or nuance about this so if you are an edgy teen who wants to justify just stay away from the comments section this is simply appalling and good on the lady for calling this boy and his shitty beliefs out there is no reason why people should not be allowed to wear the hijab it is time to relook this archaic and senseless policy sigh the fact that this is from a hindu prayer song makes it even more offensive when will these people learn i am not siam fuck girl i do not have covid i do not have covid this is a distasteful low blow there is nothing funny about this your actions following the video social media posts and interactions despite multiple comments asking you to take it down show what you really think for your information i am sorry if you were offended is not an apology the issue here is not about you not knowing what siam fuck means that is immaterial the issue here is how you were xenophobic racist and projected your prejudices on an entire nationality please do better especially since you are running a production company hey member of parliament xueling what do you mean by you can understand both sides you do know that the other side is xenophobia racism and blatant discrimination right is it so hard for people in power to simply call out racism and xenophobia why everything also need both sides this is not a gp essay also when you say things like both sides it imputes a false equivalence between those who discriminate viciously and those who are victims of the discrimination covid has nothing to do with racism racism has always been here even from our own ministers from long ago it is ironic how for the opposition the issue is sensitive and that public pressure is agressive shows how disconnected the opposition in parliament is to the general public let us see whether any singapore citizens influencers got the guts to spread this post around or are they going to keep silent just because it ruins their aesthetic lol i lose respect for those with a massive following but simply turn a blind eye towards this issue just because it does not affect them clorox not sure what you mean by taking it down in the name of racial equality might be viewed as a direct attack on chinese education but in our case there is no intention to attack chinese education like we said there are chinese language education programs in several school china studies and translation in high schools all things that will still preserve the chinese language it will be the job to ensure that any concern relating to this policy change is addressed adequately if there really is no longer any relevance for sap schools surely the government can come up with reasonable justifications for the change i did not share your sentiments and i am not keen to engage further since you still insist that you are correct lol that is similar to brown face singapore media personality wearing a tudung e pay advertisement of a man wearing a tudung a non muslim woman wearing a tudung is clearly racist and its a cultural appropriation freedom to practise any religion do not mean you are allowed to wear any religious symbol other than your faith i am sure mhra covers that we do not see malay women wearing like a nun indians trying to imitate a monk and a chinese man wearing a turban see what we said on april the incumbent government is predictable and always two steps behind last year when we called for ban on flights from wuhan we were accused of xenophobia few days later flights were indeed banned this year we called for ban on flights from india and countries like nepal sri lanka countries that indian nationals used as a third country to enter singapore again we were accused of xenophobia but look what happened today end of the day it is simple we must protect our own community first before we can protect and help others same reason why when oxygen masks drop in aircraft you put for yourself first before helping the person beside you when will we learn from our mistakes if you do not feel safe it is because of pandemic not racsim fake cry mocks indian who said minorities feel unsafe in singapore to be honest most of these are jokes i have not seen the coconut oil one before though unless the people who said it have the intent to hurt you these will be jokes this is just my opinion however there really is not a point arguing with me because i am just stating my opinion be it wrong or right to you after all right or wrong is just based on your bias no one is perfect and is born deconstructed and these parents grew up in a racist society that taught that those who are different are dangerous and these cases only strengthened this belief and believing in this they only want the best for their daughter when they said that the deconstruction is a process between her parents and him when they allow themselves to open up to each other think about it too this page is titled alternative news source the purpose of my rant is to impress upon the adminstrators anyone reading this to wake up their idea and focus on things that matter it boggles my mind how selfish humans are when it comes to their own self interests if i get into a road accident tomorrow i wish for a quick ending to avoid years of suffering on this miserable earth where people care more about being discriminated against than the lives of innocent animals i have tenant they are indians from malaysia dm me if you want to know with problems i am facing i give you my point of view from my own now i know why people have preferences does this makes me racist oh by the way i am a malay what the hell can you all stop if you guys think singapore bad than migrate lah stop complaining as yes because the way to be a decent person is to live in an echo chamber to pick one side and one side only ignoring that there is always nuance in every issue and it is never black and white never acknowledging the other side having valid arguments and concerns instead dismissing them as racist transphobic or any kind of buzzword without trying to resolve the issue and singing lalala when they are trying to explain themselves i am sorry but then i do not want to be a decent being seeing that being a decent being does not try to find actual solutions instead breaking down complicated issues into black and white trying to change our people people who do want to make this country better into who is good and who is bad breaking this country into factions i do not think compromise is always the answer but lack of communication is alway not good lack of communication almost wiped out the earth in the cold war it can destroy our country too i got my fair share of racism from indians strangers and employers terrible terrible terrible its was raining heavily and indians refuse drive away from the dropoff shelter because they were smoking and demand me to get lost while my cab is waiting behind it was a heavy downpour indian bosses are the worst of all chauvinistic men and treat me like a slave yes or no they shake their head and turn their back like fliping backpeddle i had way too stress nonsense and stress from them utterly disgusting not saying everyone is the same just my experiences this is not gp essay but i am sure has no idea since they probably did not even complete education clownery in full display no one said xenophobia or racism is okay but use some common sense to think why those people are even being xenophobic because they are afraid they might catch the virus i am not saying that it is okay to think that way it is wrong and we should educate them to not behave in such an abysmal manner so yes it is important to understand where they are coming from too and see both sides so that you can solve the problem all is doing is pour fuel into fire and run their mouths in their a es clearly been smoking weed what happened to personal preference or rather where should we draw the line between personal preference and racism just wondering that is not racist its a fact like saying asians are way more sensitive to alcohol
