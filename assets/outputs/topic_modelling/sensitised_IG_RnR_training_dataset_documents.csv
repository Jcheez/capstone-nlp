"@bgAABHt7Vq I can completely relate to your experiences too. There needs to be more active engagement on both sides. At this point it is only right that we appreciate the new Mufti's effort to reach out to more segments of the Muslim community. While the previous Mufti focused his efforts on the Malay community, with most of his lectures being in Malay, the new Mufti has however chosen to produce more English content. I was even pleasantly surprised that SalamSG TV that he launched features the Indian imams (including Bengali!!!). They even produced Tamil & Bengali subtitles for the Eid khutbah. So this definitely seems to be a promising start. At least they are making the effort to reach out to us and I definitely appreciate their efforts for that. I sincerely hope that relations and communications between the 2 communities strengthen further in future.

"@bgAABHtcR5 additionally regarding school being independent, as far as I know 50% of funding is from the Catholic Church or donation. As for your experience, it is from a time before most of the followers on this page are even born. And mine is a different phase in the recent past. There are teachers who choose to teach in English, and there are those who go on explaining the problem sum in Chinese. That is exactly what happened as recent as 7 years. Regarding music and art, the sec 1/2 depending on the teacher, yes they just give up and speak Chinese.",additionally regarding school being independent as far as i know of funding is from the catholic church or donation as for your experience it is from a time before most of the followers on this page are even born and mine is a different phase in the recent past there are teachers who choose to teach in english and there are those who go on explaining the problem sum in chinese that is exactly what happened as recent as years regarding music and antigent rapid test the sec depending on the teacher yes they just give up and speak chinese,-1

"Racism stemed from an existence of race doing a self promotion of their creed is superior to everyone else in order to continue existing as a race. A fundamental pros & cons to the racist issue. A catch 22. Racial Harmony is a different fish highlighting a friendly existence in the same space for a common good. This required a fairness & togetherness as one. Singapore with her decades of efforts & promotions have instilled a belief that Singapore as a nation is so. The recent mixed marriage uproar is of a very different dimension. No longer racial harmony of our founding. It pulled to the forefront the mixed race part of the community that are in the very minority. Presently, it is a very choice thing with new consequences faced by each union & their offsprings. If Singapore is to jump into this promotion, Singapore will need to do an upheavel on a national scale to accommodate future consequences of this new culture. As a small nation, Singapore will be hard put to dish out this to other nations. We cannot be a sanctuary for too many foreign mixed marriages. It's not a workable image attraction. We cannot be left holding the babies. Our present core society will likely be destroyed from within. The growing up pressure issues & eventual loyalty issues needs to be considered. LKY did mentioned about the Catholic network & other networks considering Singapore security. I think this new dimensional mixed race issue needs serious think in relating to both internal & external forces. We cannot be a Mecca for the many foreign mixed people out there. Singapore if going up this road embracing this new dimension needs to put in super efforts to make everything work. No nation including the US & UK has ever made this work. Singapore may need to become something else alien to what we know of Singapore today.",racism stemed from an existence of race doing a self promotion of their creed is superior to everyone else in order to continue existing as a race a fundamental pros cons to the racist issue a catch racial harmony is a different fish highlighting a friendly existence in the same space for a common good this required a fairness togetherness as one singapore with her decades of efforts promotions have instilled a belief that singapore as a nation is so the recent mixed marriage uproar is of a very different dimension no longer racial harmony of our founding it pulled to the forefront the mixed race part of the community that are in the very minority presently it is a very choice thing with new consequences faced by each union their offsprings if singapore is to jump into this promotion singapore will need to do an sudden disruption on a national scale to accommodate future consequences of this new culture as a small nation singapore will be hard put to dish out this to other nations we cannot be a sanctuary for too many foreign mixed marriages it is not a workable image attraction we cannot be left holding the babies our present core society will likely be destroyed from within the growing up pressure issues eventual loyalty issues needs to be considered singapore first prime minister did mentioned about the catholic network other networks considering singapore security i think this new dimensional mixed race issue needs serious think in relating to both internal external forces we cannot be a mecca for the many foreign mixed people out there singapore if going up this road embracing this new dimension needs to put in super efforts to make everything work no nation including the us uk has ever made this work singapore may need to become something else alien to what we know of singapore today,0
"See what we said on 22 April. The PAP is predictable and always two steps behind. Last year when we called for ban on flights from Wuhan, we were accused of Xenophobia. Few days later flights were indeed banned. This year we called for ban on flights from India and countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka (countries that Indian nationals used as a third country to enter SG). Again we were accused of xenophobia. But look what happened today. End of the day it is simple, we must protect our own community first before we can protect and help others. Same reason why when oxygen masks drop in aircraft, you put for yourself first before helping the person beside you.

"As yes, because the way to be a decent person is to live in an echo chamber, to pick one side and one side only, ignoring that there is always nuance in every issue and it is never black and white, never acknowledging the other side having valid arguments and concerns, instead dismissing them as ""racist, transphobic"" or any kind of buzzword without trying to resolve the issue, and singing lalala when they are trying to explain themselves. I'm sorry, but then I don't want to be a ""decent being"", seeing that being a ""decent being"" doesn't try to find actual solutions, instead breaking down complicated issues into black and white, trying to change our people, people who do want to make this country better, into who is ""good"" and who is ""bad"", breaking this country into factions.
