Resilience of Foreign Students Focus Group Discussion. Participants: 5 (2 male, 3 female) Participants: 3 NUS, 2 SMU, 1 Malaysian, 1 Indian, 3 Indonesians. Focus Group Transcript:Facilitator (F): Thank you guys so much for coming down. We would like to hear your opinions of, and experiences with, staying in Singapore so far. We will be having a discussion about various topics from henceforth. Please do not feel pressurized about this focus group, you can take it as quite an informal time of sharing with one another. If at any point in time you do feel uncomfortable about a particular topic that we’re talking about or you feel that you do not wish to elaborate further, just let me know. In Japan after the great earthquake students had difficulty accessing information. They ended up hearing a lot of the news from their family members back in their home countries. The way that the news was reported in these countries sort of differed from each other. Do you think Singapore might face a situation like that? If so, it wouldn’t be as big of a problem because our country is so small so whatever you hear from friends it’s easy to pass information around to one another. If there was a terrorist attack one source of information would say that there were 70 people there and another source would say there were 20 people there, I think here that may not be an issue. I think in this example though, it�'s just the news being reported from different angles rather than it being conflicting. Singaporeans trust the leaders of Singapore more than they trust their own countries, according to a recent survey. The survey asked participants about their trust in the community leaders and the national leaders. The national leaders oversee and give instructions to community leaders who fix the issues of the smaller areas. The community leaders are expected to react to the immediate needs of the residents in my area efficiently and effectively with the resources available. In times of crisis in Singapore, would you turn to your community leaders for help or would you try to seek more of the official sources like the national leader? The survey also asked participants if they felt it would be beneficial for Singapore to have more knowledge of the community leader. The results of the survey were published in the latest issue of The Straits Times magazine. AJ: I have been living here for so long that I think I mostly consider myself more of a Singaporean than an Indonesian actually. IS: I think we would only think that it is worth distrusting them when something bad happens as a result of them hiding that information.TP: For me cause I grew up in Malaysia and the culture is pretty close so when I first came here there wasn’t really much of a difficulty adapting in that sense, and as time passes I now have more friends in Singapore than in my home country. AJ: It is easy to feel part of it because it is such a small country so you will know enough aspects of it to feel like you know this place. Singapore is a very convenient and efficient place to live. The bureaucracy here is a little… I don’t know, everything takes a long time. I think it’s just that empathy for even a stranger is sort of lacking here. I feel that the system is very disadvantageous of certain people like the low skilled migrant workers. The government has been responding more and talking about it more during their speeches and such. It is more of trying to raise awareness amongst ourselves, for Singaporeans first to be more vocal about it then the government can respond. I guess it's about waiting for people to say something. It's not like specific to Singapore, it's like only when people start talking about the issue, especially like foreign migrant issues. In times of crisis, do you think that in Singapore people would reach out to help one another? We don’t really talk much to each other, but we still know that the other person exists. I feel like in situations where it can be seen that you obviously need help, then they would help. I would prioritize my family and friends first, but sometimes your friends are not very near to you, so even if you wanted to you can't really help them. I think it depends on quite a few factors as well, as to whether you would help your neighbours first or just leave them first and come back if you do have the time to help them, says AJ. In Singapore if we were to talk about your social network system, who would you guys say you rely most on? If your family was not in Singapore, would you reach out to your friends or would you feel like you would want to contact your family members instead? If you want to find someone to complain to about your results, usually I will find my friends to complain about it because they can relate more to the situation. If I’m in Jakarta, I can’t just go out whenever I feel like it. Over there I kind of have to follow her schedule because she needs the car as well, so I can't just gone out when I want to go out. Do you guys see as [rating] four as neutral or four as just being on the continuum of the rating scale?Like what parts in Singapore have allowed you to feel satisfied with? Participants express disagreement on whether Singapore should be prepared for terrorist attacks. Singaporeans are more prepared than their Malaysian counterparts, say the participants. The group also discusses how they are prepared for power cuts and flooding in their homeland. The participants also discuss how they have prepared for earthquakes and other natural disasters in their home countries. They also discuss what they have done to prepare for a possible terrorist attack in Singapore. The panel concludes with a question about preparedness for possible terrorist attacks in Singapore, and the answers are published in the online version of this article. The online version has been updated to include the responses of the participants from Singaporeans and Malaysians. For the full version of the interview, please visit: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/features/article-267092/Singapore-is-prepared-for-terrorist-attacks.html#storylink=cpy. We are happy to clarify this. Singaporeans are prepared for natural disasters but not terrorist attacks or disease outbreaks. The government is more prepared for terrorist attacks and disease outbreaks than natural disasters. The most important thing is having the experience of going through this kind of things will make it less likely for you to be overwhelmed in case the crisis happens again which is the more damaging part in terms of crisis and the damage it can deal to you.summarize: encompass: encompass. encompass. comprehend: comprehend. comprehend. comprehension: comprehend, comprehend, understand, understand. comprehension, comprehension. comprehension. comprehend, comprehension, understanding. comprehension,. comprehension. understanding, understanding, comprehending. comprehension and comprehension. AJ: I think the mental preparedness part is very difficult because it is very safe, they [Singaporeans] can’t even learn from like normal crimes in that sense. It is one thing to be aware, but another to know how close that situation is to us. I think in terms of like instructions and preparedness, like knowing what to do, when and where, I think because we have not experienced those kinds of problems here, people might not actively look for that kind of information. If it is information that you want people to know it probably has to be quite eye-catching or worth looking at, or even putting it in an entertaining manner that can go viral as opposed to just like a website or infographic. Singapore has been trying to be more proactive in terms of putting forth messages about preparedness and movements to address these issues. Many people also won’t really know what’s happening unless you are in school or you are involved in drills probably. I think in the event of a shooting I will be so unprepared because most of us would probably have never seen a gun pointed at us before and I would like just panic and stay still. If you see a fellow Singaporean student who says to you to run here, would you follow?TA: Depends on where he is running AJ: Yeah![In agreement with Participant TA]IS: I think you’ll trust anyone who seems to know what they’re saying. Singaporeans share their thoughts on what they would do if they were in an emergency situation. Students say they would probably panic and do what their instinct tells them to do. They also say that school staff would not be as prepared as they would be if they had to deal with such a situation. The students say they have never had a fire drill in their current main school building before. They say the best way to prepare is to be informed of when the drills will happen so that people can learn how to respond to such an emergency. They think that if you get used to getting surprised, when it actually happens you might just think it’s a drill. They have never participated in any drills because they don’t stay in hall. AJ: Maybe more of making people think that the problem is actually closer to us, so like what they already do like in the news they relate it to Singapore. AD: I think it matter more about what they are talking about Singapore in the first place. AJ: I feel a duty to protect and defend Singapore, so would you like to share about this? AD: Four was just neutral for me. F: Is there a reason why it is neutral and not on either end? AJ: Actually what do you mean by protect and defending? F: How did you interpret it? Aj: I was quite confused because I was thinking about different aspects of protecting the country. F. If you see people around you talking badly about Singapore, bringing Singapore down, would your rating still be four in terms of defending Singapore in that sense? Participants were asked to explain why they feel a duty to help Singaporeans in times of crisis. They were also asked if they felt a connection to Singaporeans that makes them want to help them. The group also discussed whether they would be more wary of helping people in Indonesia, where they say they have a lot of scams. The final question was whether or not they felt they had a responsibility to help others in the event of a terrorist attack or a health crisis, and if so, how they would go about doing it. The participants were then asked to share their thoughts on how they felt about helping Singaporeans during a crisis. The results were published in the latest issue of the magazine, which is also available on Kindle and Nook. Chinese-Indonesians have it as bad as like the mainland Chinese, they say. It’s especially so when a race is being attached to what they do – so like foreign migrant workers or foreign domestic workers. IS: I think at the end of the day it's all about not taking yourselves so seriously. It is important to know that we can always learn from these people even though they have another way of working – it’S another way to look at things. It's important to increase your tolerance of other people also, these kinds of misconceptions are important to understand and not generalize it to everybody – like just because one person from mainland China is like this, not everyone from mainland Chinese is like that. Indonesian students share their experiences of being treated differently in Singapore. They say they have been treated differently, both good and bad. Some have even thought of leaving Singapore to work in another country. The group also discuss the dangers of racial stereotypes in the city-state.

AJ: I think I don’t have a specific country in mind, but it’s more of thinking that I can be somewhere else and being able to experience and to have a different perspective. AD: For me is more of friends because I am only living with my sister. F2: Like in some areas the community leaders actually actively help the foreigners living in their area. AJ: Yeah I guess for me the reason would also be because of family because I’m staying here with my two older sisters. A2: If there is a better job opportunity then I might consider leaving the country but otherwise not really.
