Participants were asked to rate their level of preparedness for a crisis in Singapore. 1 would be that you do not feel prepared at all, and 7 would be extremely prepared for a Crisis. If at any point in time you do feel uncomfortable about a particular topic that we’re talking about, just let me know, that is not a problem as well. There are also no specific answers that we are looking for as well; we would just like to hear your honest thoughts. We’ll see whether or not you guys feel that you want to change or move your opinions [the post-its] and we'll see if there’s a change at the end of the discussion.summarize: If there was a terrorist attack and the communication systems are down, we rely a lot on online resources. There is no real chance that you won’t have access to any information because it spreads very far and wide. English is a language that is used most often so everyone should have at least a basic understanding of it. IS: I think here like most things it’s a very top-down approach, so as far as the accuracy of information goes. AJ: I would probably just take the two sources of information and see which one was more applicable for myself or my family. If Singapore news said the situation was okay but I felt like it would be safer taking myself and my family to Jakarta then I would just do that.  IS: In other countries there are all these concepts of citizen journalists and that is a more bottom-up approach. Singaporeans say they trust their community leaders more than their national leaders. The national leaders are more of the ones on the top trying to oversee everything while the community leaders try to give more of a closer feeling. Singaporeans also have a high rating of confidence in the leaders of the country, according to a recent survey by the Singapore Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies (SIPS) The survey asked Singaporeans to share their views on the role of community leaders in the country's leadership. The results were published in the latest issue of SIPS, which is also available on Kindle and other e-readers and on the Google Play store. For more information, go to www.sipans.com. AJ: I think more of hiding information, like essential information in time of crisis. IS: It could just be them being smart by withholding some information to a certain extent. TP: For me cause I grew up in Malaysia and the culture is pretty close so when I first came here there wasn’t really much of a difficulty adapting. AJ: I have been living here for so long that I think I mostly consider myself more of a Singaporean than an Indonesian actually. It is easy to feel part of it because it is such a small country so you will know enough aspects of it to feel like you know this place, just because it’s so small and it's so easy in that sense. AJ: I think it’s just that empathy for even a stranger is lacking here. TA: I guess that [not taking the first step] may be required for some issues, like some sensitive issues, but other aspects, they usually are quite proactive. IS: I feel that they don’t do enough to help their own people, like the ones who are very disadvantaged. I think there is obvious favour for people who are high skilled or talented as opposed to the low skilled migrant workers who receive very little profit I guess you could say. F: So to build onto that point, apart from your social network being made up of your friends and family members, but in terms of your wider community like your neighbours, do you think people would reach out to help one another? In times of trouble, I think we would still help each other – but as in it depends what sort of help also. It depends how far you want to go out of your way to help your neighbours if you don’t talk to them on a daily basis, but probably you would still be willing to help them with like little things. AD: I would prioritize my family and friends first, but sometimes your friends are not very near to you, so even if you wanted to you can't really help them. AJ: I feel like in situations where it can be seen that you obviously need help, then they would help. But in other situations, like a financial crisis, then I wouldn't think they would see the need to help as much I guess. If your family were not in Singapore, would you reach out to your friends or would you feel like you would want to contact your family members instead? If I feel that my house isn’t safe, maybe I’ll go stay at someone else’s house that is more ‘ulu’. If you want to find someone to complain to about your results, usually I will find my friends to complain about it because they can relate more to the situation. Usually I don't talk about school with my family. They just want to know whether I pass or just the overall results. If I do feel very stressed out, I will talk to them but I won't necessary talk about the results or about my studies. Do you think or actively prepare for possible terrorist attacks in Singapore? Do you think then – because a lot of Singaporeans probably think in a similar manner, whereby they don’t think it’ll ever happen here – do you think that will pose a problem for us?TA: It probably would in a sense. IS: I think yes, the fact that it has been safe for so long and people are so used to a certain level of comfort and that kind of thing. AJ: I’m much less prepared than my parents. Not because I experienced it in Jakarta but like from stories from my parents because they studied in LA. And so they will tell me what is needed so I guess I learn from other people’s stories. Singaporeans are more prepared for terrorist attacks or disease outbreaks than natural disasters, says IS. IS: Having the experience of going through this kind of things will make it less likely for you to be overwhelmed in case the crisis happens again. But I think the mental preparedness part is very difficult because it is very safe, they can’t even learn from like normal crimes in that sense, she says. "If the first terrorist attack that Singapore faces is a large scale one then I think it will be very devastating, but if they have like a small terrorist attack then people will be able to learn more easily," she adds. "So far I don't think there has been earthquakes here. But there have been earthquakes in Malaysia and Indonesia, so there might be natural disasters" AJ: I think it depends on the person. It is one thing to be aware, but another to know how close that situation is to us. I think because we have not experienced those kinds of problems here, people might not actively look for that kind of information. So if it is information that you want people to know it probably has to be quite eye-catching or worth looking at, or even putting it in an entertaining manner that can go viral as opposed to just like a website or infographic so people can take note of it. TA: Maybe like one possible way, but this might be very impractical, is to have like drills. AJ: Depending on what type of crisis I guess. So that might be something that you would have to think about if you want to do the drills. In the event of a shooting, do you think Singaporeans would mainly panic and do what their instinct tells them to do, for example like to run or to stay put? If you think that there is no problem with him then you will probably just follow his instructions. If you’re hiding and you don’t want him to know, you can message your friend and get him to call the police or something like that. If it is someone I can trust like a lecturer from SMU I would probably trust them. I think you would be more willing to trust someone if you know the person and you know they are trustworthy. I would like just panic and stay still. Whereas people in the US maybe they are more used to it so they would be. more willing, those capable of it, to charge at the person. The students say they have never had a fire drill in their current main school building before. They say staff themselves are not trained in a sense, so it is difficult to rely on them as well to be able to conduct the safety procedures safely. The students say the difference in awareness level is more of how urgent people view the issue is as opposed to how the campaign is actually doing. It is definitely higher than the terrorist ones because you have SARS and H1N1 and now you have the Zika virus, so I think there is more a sense of urgency for them because it could happen because something has happened before so they take more notice of this kind of like health issues as compared to like something that is far away from them. AD: I feel a duty to protect and defend Singapore, so would you like to share about this?TA: I think it matter more about what they are talking about Singapore in the first place. If you can understand where they’re coming from, I don’t think there’s a need to defend. So it is a culture here that is very difficult to break, you attract a lot of attention if you confront them and say this is not what it is. AJ: I was quite confused because I was thinking about different aspects of protecting the country. I think the lesson from that terrorist attack is that Singapore is not invulnerable to terrorist attacks and event from outside Singapore can still affect Singapore as the people were from the Palestinian terrorist organization. AJ: If I know that they need more people, then yeah. TP: I think it’s a bit of both. You want to help people facing difficulty, but if you do feel a connection to people around you it kind of reinforces it. IS: For me, it would be my priority to ensure that both I and my family are safe first. F: Can you share what type of stereotypes you think Singaporeans have of foreigners?TA: I would say there are different stereotypes for different nationalities. I think we might be saying yes now, but it might not be the case when it actually happens. I don’t know, it depends on the situation. A lot of stories of people helping people and they end up getting robbed so there is a lot of considerations to take note of. Indonesians have stereotypes of Singaporeans, but not as bad as the mainland Chinese, they say. They say that we can learn a lot from other people, even if we don't agree with their way of working. They also say that they have experiences where they have been treated differently, where it is a good thing and a bad thing. For example, in school we have exchange students and some of us may be less willing to work with an American because we think that they are more lazy, so that kind of thing but it is important to bear in mind thatWe can also learn from their perspective and how they look at work. AJ: I think I don’t have a specific country in mind, but it’s more of thinking that I can be somewhere else and being able to experience and to have a different perspective. AD: For me is more of friends because I am only living with my sister. The thing linking me to Singapore then are probably just my friends. AJ: I can see myself going somewhere else because my two sisters are about to leave already, so I’ll be the only one here. I would want to be able to explore the same somewhere else also, like for another aspect of my life. So it's like part of my family is here and it's close to Malaysia so it's easy for me to be here working and also see my family once in a while. AJ: What kind of help? If there is a racial riot, that kind of stuff. AD: I wouldn’t think of it. But other than that, I think I
