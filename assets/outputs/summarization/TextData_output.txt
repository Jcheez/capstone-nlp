Resilience of Foreign Students Focus Group Discussion. Participants: 5 (2 male, 3 female) Participants: 3 NUS, 2 SMU, 1 Malaysian, 1 Indian, 3 Indonesians, 21 – 24 years old. Focus Group Transcript:Facilitator (F): Thank you guys so much for coming down. We would like to hear your opinions of, and experiences with, staying in Singapore so far. If there are no further questions, I will be handing out a consent form for everyone to sign. This is also for your own assurance in knowing that confidentiality will indeed be ensured. We will be having a discussion about various topics from henceforth. Please do not feel pressurized about this focus group, you can take it as quite an informal time of sharing with one another. AJ: I think in comparison to our own countries, we can trust the leaders here more. IS: Back in my home country, everyday there is a new scandal being reported about the politicians. AD: I don’t really think language is much of a problem here, in the sense that English is a language that is used most often so everyone should have at least a basic understanding of it.  If Singapore news said the situation was okay but I felt like it would be safer taking myself and my family to Jakarta then I would just do that.  Participants all express agree with the latter option as their choice. The survey also asked participants about their trust in community leaders and the national leaders. The results of the survey will be published in next week’s issue of The Straits Times. Singaporeans share their views on the government and community leaders. Participants say they feel more connected to Singaporean culture than home. They also say that they feel the system is very disadvantageous of certain people like the low skilled migrant workers. They say that for a country that prides itself on efficiency, there is something lacking in the government's response to the migrant crisis and the refugee issue. The survey is open to the general public and has been moderated by The Straits Times’ editorial team.

AJ: I think we would still help each other – but as in it depends what sort of help also. AD: I would prioritize my family and friends first, but sometimes your friends are not very near to you, so even if you wanted to you can’t really help them. IS: Actually I have a lot more Singaporean friends, but my closest friends tend to be Indians also.  F: In Singapore if we were to talk about your social network system, who would you guys say you rely most on? AD: Friends. Is: Maybe there was just no chance in the first place to make friends with other foreigners. F: Do you think you can rely on your neighbours, if for example you had gotten injured while trying to evacuate? AJ: It depends on what kind of situation. AJ: I guess first I will reach out to my closest circle of friends. AD: Usually I don’t talk about school with my family. AJ: If you want to find someone to complain to about your results, usually I will find my friends to complain about it. AD/TA: I see four as a neutral rating. F: So what aspects would cause you to put that particular rating for your satisfaction with life in Singapore? If I’m in Jakarta, I can’s just go out whenever I feel like it.  And so over there I kind of have to follow her schedule because she needs the car as well. Whereas over here, I think it would just be a bit sudden.  So if we go back for a moment to the topic of crisis preparedness, do you guys think or actively prepare for possible terrorist attacks in Singapore?" Participant IS says he is prepared for electricity failure so he probably has torchlight or batteries. AJ: I think for me, I’m much less prepared than my parents. TA: I know how to prepare for an earthquake because when I was young in Jakarta there were a few earthquakes as well. AJ: It is one thing to be aware, but another to know how close that situation is to us. Some people may not even think that it’s possible to happen here. So if it is information that you want people to know it probably has to be quite eye-catching or worth looking at, or even putting it in an entertaining manner that can go viral as opposed to just like a website or infographic so people can take note of it. Singaporeans view terrorist attacks as something that is happening far away like in the US or in Europe. If you were in school and there’s a man wearing a vest loaded with bombs in your school, what would you do? AD: I will try to get away from the school, like as far as possible. TA: I guess Singaporeans won’t be able to do that – to do what they tell us to do because we’ll just be super scared and shocked. IS: I think this applies for all other kinds of organizations as well – at least when they join, maybe not regularly, but employees generally must be made to attend a workshop on what they should do in case of an emergency.  So I think they would definitely be more prepared than us who have never been exposed to learning about what to do in emergencies. All: Fire drills. AD: They ask us to ignore the fire drill. AJ: In NUS I’ve never [participated in any drills] because I don’t stay in hall. TP: Yeah, for halls they do fire drills very frequently. If you live on the 17th floor you have to walk all the way down. IS: For SMU, they send emails. AJ: If it is legit, if they have a basis for criticising Singapore then there is nothing to defend. TA: Also I think the terrorist campaign, the SG Secure? I think it is a relatively new one so it might not be like everywhere yet whereas posters of dengue and other stuffs, because they have been around for a long time you see them everywhere. Participant AD says it is a culture that is very difficult to break, you attract a lot of attention if you confront them and say this is not what it is. If they are friends they would probably tell you why they think it is like that. AD: Not so much of trying to convince them but sharing another side of it [what they haven’t experienced]. IS: For me I think it would be my priority to ensure that both I and my family are safe first, then when that is proven and we can help, then I think yes we can go out and help others. But the first thing is to ensure your close family and friends are safe. TA: I would say there are different stereotypes for different nationalities. As Indonesian Chinese, we blend in quite well. But I have seen my Indian friends and my Filipino friends get remarks like, why are you here, you are going to be a maid anyway so why bother studying. AJ: Everyone holds stereotypes of everyone else. TA: I have experiences where I have been treated differently, where it is a good thing and a bad thing. IS: You just have to understand that it is their fault. F: Has anyone of you ever thought that you were treated differently in Singapore because you are a foreigner? 1:39:51–IS: Occasionally when you’re in public, like I don’t usually go around by taxi but sometimes there’s the usual comments of ‘oh you�’ve come from India to take our jobs’ or something.  TA: Yeah probably to live somewhere else.  F: Have you ever been discriminated against because of your race or nationality? If so, please share your story with us. AJ: I think I don’t have a specific country in mind, but it’s more of thinking that I can be somewhere else and being able to experience and to have a different perspective.TP: For me, my elder sister is here. AD: The thing linking me to Singapore then are probably just my friends. TA: It is the distance between Singapore and Indonesia as well. It is really convenient so if there is any emergency it is easy to just go back. If there is a racial riot, that kind of stuff. I would just hide in my friend”s house, it will probably be safer. AJ: Yeah I guess for me the reason would also be because of family because I'm staying here with my two older sisters.
