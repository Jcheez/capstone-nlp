Facilitator (F): Thank you guys so much for coming down. So as Jethro has mentioned, we will be talking about resilience and different topics about resilience. We would like to hear your opinions of, and experiences with, staying in Singapore so far. We will be audio recording the session but there will be no names mentioned in any of the presentations or reports. If there are no further questions, I will be handing out a consent form for everyone to sign. This is also for your own assurance in knowing that confidentiality will indeed be ensured. 
We will be having a discussion about various topics from henceforth; please do not feel pressurized about this focus group, you can take it as quite an informal time of sharing with one another. If at any point in time you do feel uncomfortable about a particular topic that we’re talking about or you feel that you do not wish to elaborate further, just let me know, that is not a problem as well. But otherwise, there are no right or wrong answers. There are also no specific answers that we are looking for as well; we would just like to hear your honest thoughts. 
Shall we start first with introductions from everyone? Please share your name, where you are from (your country of birth) and how long you’ve stayed in Singapore.
