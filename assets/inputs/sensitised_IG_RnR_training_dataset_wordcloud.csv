Our measures lack the early treatment component. And needs a reboot. This is the closest the Govt will come to admitting they screwed up:- ‚ÄúAirport workers from a zone which received arrivals from higher-risk countries went to have their meals at Terminal 3 Basement 2. ‚ÄúAnd we suspect from there, it transmitted to members of public that visited the place,‚Äù Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said.‚Äù WP's @bgAABHtSPs hits the nail on its head.

We hope the stories of these inspirational people in our community will continue to motivate you well into the new year #kauilhamku‚ú®] You know, when people tell me that they are surprised by the racist outbursts or ask questions like ""Wah teacher leh? How can like that?"" I will tell them to go talk to any working class minority and I can guarantee you they will share similar lived experiences. In the past few days, we have received many messages from all of you who have shared about your experiences with racism. We appreciate your trust and confidentiality in us and we will always strive to listen and advocate for all of you. Recent events have shown me that one thing is clear. We will no longer remain silent or be resigned to fate. We will no longer accept that this is the way things are. If you are racist, you will be held accountable. We will call it out. We will demand accountability. And we will fight for a more just and equitable society for all of us. Racial Harmony is not a one day school celebration, but an ongoing struggle. We at @bgAABHtUgb will always be on the side of the struggle. #CALLITOUTSG I totally feel seen #CALLITOUTSG This is hard to read. A Sikh boy shares with us about his experiences with racism in school. In these submissions, we hear from people of different races and faiths who share their experiences with discrimination in school. #CALLITOUTSG This appears to show teachers discussing a parent's complaint about their child being group with people of other races. If this is true, I really pity the teachers. They are in a difficult situation. It must be very difficult for teachers to help children recognise and unlearn racial biases when their parents are the source of the racism. #CALLITOUTSG ""Now, I would like to get into the details of this term ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù that we Singaporeans use. I would like to clarify that Indian is not a language but a race; and importantly, Hindu is not a language but a religion. We do not speak Indian or Hindu that some do ask. We speak Tamil or Hindi or many other languages. Did you know that there are more than 19,500 languages or dialects spoken in India as mother tongues, according to the latest analysis of a census released?"" - Rukhshana Maufiqah Illustration by @bgAABHtIrm Speaking of holidays - I was the Camp Duty Officer for BOTH Chinese New Year holidays as a newly commissioned SAF officer. Probably against protocol but I was green and clueless and the only non-Chinese junior officer in the whole camp so it's obligatory right? (/s) Still on NS - as a reservist they conducted a one-day ICT briefing callup on Hari Raya Eve. This time I flipped and asked why this day, of all days, for a briefing?? Would they have called us up on CNY eve, I asked. No response to that, but they eventually relented and changed the date. Time to stand up and speak up. Agents who discriminate based on race can be reported to the CEA. Check out our IG highlights on rental racism for more information. The Anti-Racism Coalition Singapore (ARCS) is putting together a shadow report to submit to the UN Convention for Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD)! ARCS is doing a survey gather more meaningful data on the themes of freedom of expression, housing, employment and education, which will be included in the report. This survey is aims to center the voices and experiences of minority racial groups in Singapore. 

If you‚Äôre a person from a minority racial group who is living/has previously lived in Singapore, please take the survey! We need to collect 400 responses in 2 weeks. We would also appreciate it if you could share the survey with family, friends, co-workers, acquaintances who are also an ethnic minority in Singapore. 

The shadow report will also be shared publicly once we have finished it!

The team is led by brown people. the individual identities of the team members cannot be divulged due to safety reasons. You can reach out to the team at antiracism.coalitionsg@protonmail.com should you have any questions and/or feedback! In yesterday‚Äôs IPS-RSIS forum about race and racism in Singapore, it was said that facing discrimination when looking for a job is a form of micro-aggression. We have to disagree. It is a form of blatant racism. Also, considering how most of the SAP schools are top schools too in their own merit and are known to produce many of Singapore's future leaders, the fact that they remain almost mono-ethnically Chinese do mean that, in a sense, Chinese representation is guaranteed at the highest level of leadership within the government. But then again, a vast majority of selected scholars are Chinese anyway... @bgAABHtYzn I remember social studies preaching Singapore's emphasis on meritocracy, in essence that's supposed to mean that education is ""the great leveller"". By that logic, isn't the existence of SAP schools be hypocritical? I feel that such schools are one of many reasons why the best we can ever achieve is racial tolerance. YES. This was a big surprise to me moving to SG. It's absolutely awful & rampant. @bgAABHtc47 Your experience may give the impression to non-Chinese that all SAP schools teach Maths in Chinese, other than Chinese language and literature or some non-examinable Humanities subjects like music and art. @bgAABHtcR5 additionally regarding school being independent, as far as I know 50% of funding is from the Catholic Church or donation. As for your experience, it is from a time before most of the followers on this page are even born. And mine is a different phase in the recent past. There are teachers who choose to teach in English, and there are those who go on explaining the problem sum in Chinese. That is exactly what happened as recent as 7 years. Regarding music and art, the sec 1/2 depending on the teacher, yes they just give up and speak Chinese. @bgAABHtI26 lol that‚Äôs similar to brown face. Deekosh wearing a tudung, E pay advertisement of a man wearing a tudung, a non muslim woman wearing a tudung is clearly racist and its a cultural appropriation. Freedom to practise any religion do not mean you are allowed to wear any religious symbol other than your faith. Im sure MHRA covers that. We dont see malay women wearing like a nun, indians trying to imitate a monk and a chinese man wearing a turban? Racism stemed from an existence of race doing a self promotion of their creed is superior to everyone else in order to continue existing as a race. A fundamental pros & cons to the racist issue. A catch 22. Racial Harmony is a different fish highlighting a friendly existence in the same space for a common good. This required a fairness & togetherness as one. Singapore with her decades of efforts & promotions have instilled a belief that Singapore as a nation is so. The recent mixed marriage uproar is of a very different dimension. No longer racial harmony of our founding. It pulled to the forefront the mixed race part of the community that are in the very minority. Presently, it is a very choice thing with new consequences faced by each union & their offsprings. If Singapore is to jump into this promotion, Singapore will need to do an upheavel on a national scale to accommodate future consequences of this new culture. As a small nation, Singapore will be hard put to dish out this to other nations. We cannot be a sanctuary for too many foreign mixed marriages. It's not a workable image attraction. We cannot be left holding the babies. Our present core society will likely be destroyed from within. The growing up pressure issues & eventual loyalty issues needs to be considered. LKY did mentioned about the Catholic network & other networks considering Singapore security. I think this new dimensional mixed race issue needs serious think in relating to both internal & external forces. We cannot be a Mecca for the many foreign mixed people out there. Singapore if going up this road embracing this new dimension needs to put in super efforts to make everything work. No nation including the US & UK has ever made this work. Singapore may need to become something else alien to what we know of Singapore today. I understand chinese accents better"

We do not struggle alone. Neither do we succeed alone.‚Å† ‚Å† This #IWD, we hold deeply to these words of Angela Davis: ‚ÄúIt is in collectivities that we find reservoirs of hope and optimism.‚Äù‚Å† ‚Å† From everyone in Penawar, Happy International Women‚Äôs Day! ‚ú®‚Å† ‚Å† (ps.

Join us tomorrow! üëã @bgAABHt7Vq I can completely relate to your experiences too. There needs to be more active engagement on both sides. At this point it is only right that we appreciate the new Mufti's effort to reach out to more segments of the Muslim community. While the previous Mufti focused his efforts on the Malay community, with most of his lectures being in Malay, the new Mufti has however chosen to produce more English content. I was even pleasantly surprised that SalamSG TV that he launched features the Indian imams (including Bengali!!!). They even produced Tamil & Bengali subtitles for the Eid khutbah. So this definitely seems to be a promising start. At least they are making the effort to reach out to us and I definitely appreciate their efforts for that. I sincerely hope that relations and communications between the 2 communities strengthen further in future. It doesn't have to be based upon the number of mixed marriages per se, but a change of perspective towards the other race might be a good start :) Be an ally. Link in bio.

1,"Major spoilers ahead. But trust us, there is no huge loss if you have not watched this movie. On a personal note, we have not seen the movie since the first time we did in 2011, and we could not sit through the whole movie again to create this post. Yes, it is THAT bad. PS. Links to further reading are in our bio! It so amazing and you guys don‚Äôt think so.. sometime looking at them which make your day when you had a busy day! Having a cup of hot coffee, relax your mind while you enjoy watching them .. When is Phase 2? I'm still waiting for our MPs and ministers to take a 60% pay cut because half the time they've not been working much since Covid and the other half of the time they're bumbling about trying to deal with their ignorance, lack of specialised knowledge, banality and lack of common sense. If Malaysia can implement salary cuts for their Ministers and MPs (who do more than ours do, as their country is not the size of a postage stamp), we can certainly do the same too... Preaching words of hope and resilience to us ordinary citizens while they still draw the minimum $16k a month (or in the case of DP, for instance, millions a month) hits very different esp to those who are struggling desperately to earn even $160 a month while jobless and unable to get a job for more than a year. The words of a man with a cushy job and never had to go around begging for thousands of jobs ring very different from the words of another who is starving to death and battling depression in this climate. Honestly, during situations like these, we rather be proven wrong. Ng Yat Chung should resign. This former general ran both NOL and SPH to the ground. And if his behaviour at the press conference earlier is anything to go by, things will not improve with him at the helm. Shareholders must demand accountability from him and the rest of the board. In any other place he would have been sacked by now. End of story. We seriously don't understand why this is so hard to grasp for some. It is a shame that this even has to be spelt out. Let's combat racism together. Another NJC alumna speaks up. Also, this may be an opportune time to remind everyone that just because Ms X wasn't racist or was nice towards you, it doesn't mean that she couldn't have been racist or unreasonable towards others. --- ‚ÄúWhile I am ethnically Chinese and did not face specifically racist treatment from her, I stand with my fellow minority friends, many of whom have faced such horrible experiences. I am writing in because I firmly believe that one teacher cannot act so outrageously for decades without being held accountable if there is a sound mechanism within the NJC system that regulates this. It cannot be that the NJC staff are completely unaware of her acts, as evidences by the numerous comments (over 200 thus far) with students and ex-students from across a decade sharing similar experiences, and many pointing out that they know who the teacher is right from the description. As such, it simply cannot be that the school has been unaware of it all these years.‚Äù #CALLITOUTSG Dear killshot, whoever you are, we want you to know that you are not alone. You will never be alone, friend. The community here will always have your back. We will continue to relentlessly advocate and fight for all minorities to have a better and more just future. We are clearly on the right track - we have made people like him so uncomfortable. That is the power of truth. The truth may be uncomfortable, but ignoring it doesn't change anything. I'll personally never understand why people get so worked up or defensive when stories about racism are shared. We will not let the naysayers and the doubters derail our efforts, not even for a second. Racists don't take a break so why should we. This is the very real effect of gaslighting and downplaying the experiences of minorities. But we must not let it get to us. The anti-racism movement will prevail, as history has always shown. We receive some hate messages everyday, that is fine. But don't go after those who entrust us with their stories and confide in us. For you to go after victims of racism, that's a low-blow. Minorities can't ever speak up without getting gaslighted or having doubt thrown at their stories. You want to know why so many stories sound similar? It's because so many minorities share similar lived experiences. For the record, every word, every emotion, every experience in the #CALLITOUTSG series is real. It may be hard for you to believe because of your privilege, but it is 100% real. Let me make this clear. We will not stand for any gaslighting or victim-blaming. You are free to attack us but don't go after the authenticity of the experiences we share when you don't even have a shred of evidence. If you want to ""bet real money"", put your money where your mouth is. We will donate all the monies to mutual aid. --- P.S. If you want to know what are CaiusG's views on racism, go check out his comment history ;) I hope next time when minorities speak up, we take them seriously. We shouldn't accuse them of stirring religious tensions or sedition. We should also think about what kind of signals are sent when we say things like ""We are not ready for an Indian PM"" or ""if you naughty, apunene will come catch you"". Such rhetoric is hurtful to minorities and it also serves to normalise racism. We all want to work together against racism. Sometimes, this work involves serious reflection and difficult conversations. But it must be done. Repost from @bgAABHtDUK We also hope that going forward, when minorities speak up about racism and Chinese privilege, we hear them out, take their concerns seriously and have difficulty but necessary conversations about race instead of accusing them of sedition or stirring racial tensions. Although I might have accidentally say these remarks in the past I will be a good ally from now and don't encourage racism against minority @bgAABHtlg_ thank you! we must all work together to end racism at its roots. It exists and it is a problem. Gaslighting makes it difficult to snuff out. It pays to be cautious and aware! @bgAABHtILu üòî sorry that you had to go through that. Wish there was a National anti discrimination rule carried out by MOM on this. Rejecting competent workers just because they choose to practice their religious beliefs, doesn‚Äôt match with sg ‚Äòs multi racial and religious harmony identity that the country‚Äôs often being promoted as. Even National sports teams must wear uniforms but some countries allow their players to wear simple head covering and inner sleeves /leggings inside the team‚Äôs sports uniform. ‚Äú‚ÄòAre you going back to Malaysia ?‚Äô My sister took it lightly and explained that the luggage was for me and she had come to drop it off. He simple added, ‚ÄúGo back lah. Go back to Malaysia. Go back now. We don‚Äôt want you here.‚Äù His tone progressively got more aggressive towards the end. ‚Ä¶ I told my sister then - enough is enough. We should no longer stay silent. We have as much right to be here as anyone else. We need to speak up, make it difficult for people to be comfortable with racism, and stand up for ourselves. I would not want for us to keep silent for this is not the Singapore I would want my children to grow up in. The experience left me so frustrated that I couldn‚Äôt do anything more. We waited till our GrabCar came and left.‚Äù ‚Äúthis is definitely not what i want to teach my child in the near future and i hope that we will be able to change our mindset as times goes by. come on, we are in the 21st century and im pretty sure everyone will have to go through proper education in singapore. with all the news outlet reporting about racism cases, with all the stories about racism being shared around, i hope that we all will be able to change our mindset and also educate the people around us. its 2021 and if you‚Äôre still being racist to others, here‚Äôs a big fuck you. you have no fucking idea how much it hurts to be discriminated against just because you have a different skin tone. lets be more open minded and accepting towards others please.‚Äù A Chinese lady who is in an inter-racial relationship with an Indian man faces racism from her own family. #CALLITOUTSG Most of us Indian Muslims can relate to this to some extent. I believe this situation arises out of a lack of awareness and education. These kinds of things should have been taught in all those social studies or CME lessons in primary schools. Concepts such as race and religion are still not so clear to some Chinese. My colleague asked me ""Are you Indian or Muslim?'. I replied ""Both"" and he looked surprised. üôÑ I‚Äôve always noticed the way race and religion have seemed more separate for some and synonymous for others. Being Malay and Muslim to me, in my experience, has been a commonly understood norm in society, where race and religion overlap. However, being Indian and Muslim is always perceived to be antonymous. One is the opposite of the other instead of sharing the same space. ‚Å£ ‚Å£ Even till now, I notice the ease of which other Muslims who look the part, can do things while someone like myself, am restricted socially by odd looks or sometimes the inability of others to comprehend how an Indian can be Indian and Muslim. - Sarah Farheenshah Begum‚Å£ ""I was probably the most proud to be a south Asian Muslim woman when I‚Äôm in the presence of my family, and still am til today. To be honest, I never felt proud to be south Asian when I was in school. I always felt a little left out. Some teachers would purposely fake an indian accent (even though I wasn‚Äôt Indian) in front of the whole class when talking to me, and classmates would talk about me while being in my presence, thinking I didn‚Äôt understand a word they were saying. Being in such an environment made me feel embarrassed about my ethnicity."" - FZ, Sri Lankan When will the blatant discrimination end? Looks like there‚Äôs something happening to Indian folks in Singapore every week. This is disrespectful to people of the Hindu faith. What‚Äôs the point of mocking religious activities? How intolerant has this country become? üò¢ Reminiscent of the racial insults I had endured in primary school too My sister shared with me before about a poly mate making fun of an Indian girl.He said anyone who wants chocolate milk can go to Devi ( not the real name ).He laughed coz he thought it was a funny joke. It's downright rude,racist and totally unacceptable! Ah this one hits so close to home...i didnt alienate myself from my faith as a Sikh but there were plenty of experiences i faced that honestly made me question why i even bothered. People can be so demeaning and rude. I won't ask people to respect my faith, that's unfortunately too much to ask. I just wish they would leave me alone This is a breakdown based on our own opinion and understanding of what has happened. This is not meant to sow any religious/racial discord or cause enmity. The first step in tackling racism is acknowledging the problem exists. When minorities point out racism, it is not with any intention to sow racial/religious discord or enmity. The intention is to raise awareness, have open and respectful conversations about these issues, and collectively overcome them. üí¨ We need to be able to acknowledge such race-related issues in Singapore and address them. We are not trying to assign blame. Open conversations are always helpful in understanding one another better and strengthening our relationships. Dear @bgAABHtrmf , is it so hard to use the word ""racist""? ""I also want to add that people may push back that this is a grey area but it really isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just a way to justify racism."" Preferences can be racist. #CALLITOUTSG The Security Association of Singapore calls out racism and ageism from a Managing Agent. The Managing Agent has since issued an apology. This Christmas, we wish for an end to casual racism, especially in the form of jokes like these. No, they are not funny. If you hear such jokes being made, even if minorities laugh along (internalised racism is a convo for another day), don't hesitate to call it out. We agree. But we need to see more concrete action, including corrective action. For example, we could start with rental racism. We have one of the most educated populations in the world and we are more than capable about having a civil discussion about race. We need more honest and frank discussions. We also must ensure that laws like Sedition and Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act do not unintentionally deter much needed honest and open conversations about race relations in Singapore. Pretending everything is fine and dandy is not the way forward. We hope this changes and is not just lip service. Reposting because our previous post got removed with no reasons stated. The next time you face a racist landlord or agent, take a few moments to complain to CEA. Together, we will fight racism. As Muslims, it is our spiritual duty to be steadfast to the principles of social justice and deep compassion in Islam. It is not enough to be passive and fall onto the ease of toxic positivity, we must be active in doing the personal and communal work of eradicating violent systems in our lives. Allah has created diversity in humankind by design, so that we may appreciate each other‚Äôs differences and respect them, understanding that it doesn‚Äôt change the essential fact that we are all God‚Äôs beautiful creations. ‚Å£ You should not downplay racism by saying it‚Äôs a ‚Äújoke‚Äù. Who‚Äôs laughing? Sexual racism is an important topic that queer organisations need to address, educate and stand against. Dating and sexual ‚Äúpreferences‚Äù don‚Äôt arise in a vacuum. We are influenced by our implicit biases, racial stereotypes, media portrayals of ethnic minorities and many more. To say that it is simply a preference absolves individuals of any responsibility which is extremely common in the gay community. 

Gay folks should not only fight for equality in terms of LGBTQIA+ rights but also fight against racism within their own community and elsewhere. If not, we will never achieve collective liberation. I really hope the govt reconsiders the need to hold open discussions as you have articulated in your post. It just feels rather authoritarian that such decisions were made with people in certain positions without taking into account the public's views. what divisive issue? it doesn‚Äôt make sense at all to me, bc if it was stated in the nation‚Äôs pledge ‚Äúregardless of race, language or religion‚Äù why should there be a divisive issue abt this tudung controversy? if there is a problem, the government should face it head on and learn to fix it instead of just putting it off as a divisive issue or ‚Äúmaking others uncomfortable‚Äù those are just excuses that doesn‚Äôt add up to any value, prove to us that instead of just putting it off they will do something abt it NOW, its 2021 ppl its time to move forward from irrelevant issues like these and just learn to respect everyone‚Äôs religions @bgAABHtcTo yes but the pressure has to come from 'ordinary citizens' as you say. If there is no pressure or discussion at parliament the govt wont see the need to even think about it. So ordinary citizens need to take steps to make this issue viral enough to get policymakers to debate on it Look at this tasteless video by @bgAABHtRWO (the PAP candidate who lost in Sengkang). I don't think the racist attack is something that we can and should make light of. We also shouldn't be portraying vile racist attackers in such a fun and harmless light. We need some clarity from the Police as to when and why they ask people to file Magistrate's Complaint before commencing investigations? Is this also the norm for cases involving domestic abuse or violence? It's honestly quite sad and concerning why this victim of a racially charged assault was told to file a Magistrate's Complaint. We really need some answers. ""I cried watching #BLM the other day... AND YOURE CALLING ME A RACIST?!"" Is this some kind of sick joke, @/eudxria ? As far as ""apologies"" go - and we have see many - this is the worst and most appalling. Why do people love talking down to migrant workers? Do they think they are superior human beings or something? Thank you, Gangaa for calling this out and standing up for them. #CALLITOUTSG Nazi symbols must be banned. Sympathisers must be re-educated or counselled. Plain and simple. There is no fucking room for debate or nuance about this. So if you're an edgy teen who wants to justify just stay away from the comments section. This is simply appalling and good on the lady for calling this boy and his shitty beliefs out. There is no reason why people shouldn't be allowed to wear the hijab. It is time to relook this archaic and senseless policy. Sigh... The fact that this is from a Hindu prayer song makes it even more offensive. When will these people learn? ""I'm not siam diu girl. I don't have Covid! I don't have Covid!"" This is a distasteful lowblow, @bgAABHt71L . There is nothing funny about this. Your actions following the video (social media posts and interactions) despite multiple comments asking you to take it down show what you really think. FYI, ""I'm sorry if you were offended"" is not an apology. The issue here is not about you not knowing what ""siam diu"" means. That is immaterial. The issue here is how you were xenophobic, racist, and projected your prejudices on an entire nationality. Please do better, especially since you are running a Production Company. TW: Use of the n-word (video is in the last slide) We hope @bgAABHtz8y.sg comes clean on why they claimed to be not able to find models from the minority races when instead they chose not to hire them. To be clear, this is not a situation where they simply decided not to hire diverse models. Rather, they chose not to hire and then pretended that they couldn't find any. We understand that this thing where fashion shops only feature Chinese models of a particular body build is not limited to just this shop. We believe that it is indeed important for fashion shops in Singapore to cater for, and feature, a diverse range of models. Hey MP @bgAABHtRWS.xueling , what do you mean by you can understand ""both sides""? You do know that the other side is xenophobia, racism and blatant discrimination right? Is it so hard for people in power to simply call out racism and xenophobia? Why everything also need both sides? This is not a GP essay. Also, when you say things like both sides, it imputes a false equivalence between those who discriminate viciously, and those who are victims of the discrimination. Covid has nothing to do with racism. Racism has always been here even from our own ministers from long ago. It's ironic how, for the 'opposition' the issue is sensitive, and that public pressure is 'agressive'. Shows how disconnected the opposition in parliament is to the general public. Bruh, sg doesn't have much freedom, literally officers can enter your house without a warrant. There's nothing that you can do to stop the pap, its like telling the ccp to not do something. It doesn't work Let‚Äôs see whether any Singaporean ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù got the guts to spread this post around or are they gonna keep silent just because it ruins their aesthetic lol. I lose respect for those with a massive following but simply turn a blind eye towards this issue just because it doesn‚Äôt affect them. @bgAABHtJ5q.clorox Not sure what you mean by ""taking it down in the name of racial equality might be viewed as a direct attack on Chinese education"". But in our case, there is no intention to attack Chinese education. Like we said, there are Chinese Language Education Programs in several school, China studies and Translation in JCs, all things that will still preserve the Chinese language. It will be the government's job to ensure that any concern relating to this policy change is addressed adequately. If there really is no longer any relevance for SAP schools, surely the government can come up with reasonable justifications for the change. @bgAABHtpZ4 I did not share your sentiments and I am not keen to engage further since you still insist that you are correct. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è @bgAABHtHmF now you're making untruthful statements about the impression. I make no mention of that, and simply stated the facts of what happen 7 years ago, ask any students then, the math classes for most of the good math teachers were in Chinese, that is exactly what happen. See what we said on 22 April. The PAP is predictable and always two steps behind. Last year when we called for ban on flights from Wuhan, we were accused of Xenophobia. Few days later flights were indeed banned. This year we called for ban on flights from India and countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka (countries that Indian nationals used as a third country to enter SG). Again we were accused of xenophobia. But look what happened today. End of the day it is simple, we must protect our own community first before we can protect and help others. Same reason why when oxygen masks drop in aircraft, you put for yourself first before helping the person beside you. When will we learn from our mistakes? ""If you don't feel safe it is because of pandemic not racsim"" *fake cry*

@bgAABHt3Wg mocks Indian who said minorities feel unsafe in Singapore. Tbh most of these are jokes. I haven't seen the coconut oil one before tho. Unless the ppl who said it have the intent to hurt you, these will be jokes. This is just my opinion however. There really isn't a point arguing with me bcos im just stating my opinion be it wrong or right to you. After all, right or wrong is just based on your bias no one is perfect and is born deconstructed and open-minded, these parents grew up in a racist society that taught that those who are different are dangerous and these ""cases"" only strengthened this belief, and believing in this they only want the best for their daughter when they said that, the deconstruction is a process between her parents and him when they allow themselves to open up to each other, think about it too... @bgAABHtJ26 this page is titled WakeUpSingapore. The purpose of my rant is to impress upon the admins, anyone reading this to wake up their idea and focus on things that MATTER. It boggles my mind how selfish humans are when it comes to their own self interests. If I get into a road accident tomorrow, I wish for a quick ending to avoid years of suffering on this miserable earth where people care more about being discriminated against than the lives of innocent animals I have 2 tenant..they're Indians..from Malaysia. DM me if you want to know with problems im facing. I give you my point of view from my own personal.experience. Now i know why ppl have preferences. Does this makes me racist? Oh..by the way im a Malay. Wth, can y'all stop. If u guys think sg bad, than migrate lah. Stop complaining As yes, because the way to be a decent person is to live in an echo chamber, to pick one side and one side only, ignoring that there is always nuance in every issue and it is never black and white, never acknowledging the other side having valid arguments and concerns, instead dismissing them as ""racist, transphobic"" or any kind of buzzword without trying to resolve the issue, and singing lalala when they are trying to explain themselves. I'm sorry, but then I don't want to be a ""decent being"", seeing that being a ""decent being"" doesn't try to find actual solutions, instead breaking down complicated issues into black and white, trying to change our people, people who do want to make this country better, into who is ""good"" and who is ""bad"", breaking this country into factions. I don't think compromise is always the answer, but lack of communication is alway not good. Lack of communication almost wiped out the earth in the Cold War, it can destroy our country too. I got my fair share of racism from indians, strangers and employers. Terrible twrribl terrible. Its was raining heavily and indians refuse drive away from the dropoff shelter cause they were smoking and demand me to get lost while my cab is waiting behind. It was a heavy downpour. Indian bosses are the worst of all. Chauvinistic men and treat me like a slave. yes or no they shake their head. and turn their back like fliping prata. i had way too stress nonsensd and stress from them. utterly Disgusting. Not saying everyone is the same. Just my experiences. this is not GP essay but i‚Äôm sure @bgAABHtxNH has no idea since they probably didn‚Äôt even complete pre-school education. clownery in full display. no one said. xenophobia or racism is okay. but use some common sense to think why those people are even being xenophobic. bcos they‚Äôre afraid they might catch the virus. i‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs okay to think that way. it‚Äôs wrong and we should educate them to not behave in such an abysmal manner. so yes, it‚Äôs important to understand where they‚Äôre coming from too and see both sides so that you can solve the problem. all @bgAABHtq0D is doing is pour fuel into fire and run their mouths in their a$$es. clearly been smoking weed what happened to personal preference,, or rather where should we draw the line between personal preference and racism? just wondering Thats not racist its a fact like saying asians are way more sensitive to alcohol"
